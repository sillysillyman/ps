### 문제 설명

<p>Miss Fotheringale is teaching her maths class about plotting graphs. As a first exercise, she wants them to plot a linear graph y = ax + b for values of x from 0 to 10 inclusive.</p>

<p>She wants you to help by writing a program that outputs the correct answers to make it easier for her to mark her pupils' work.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input is a single number N, 0 < N < 30, a positive integer that tells the number of graphs to be plotted.</p>

<p>N lines then follow, each representing one graph to be plotted. Each line contains 2 non-negative integers, A and B, 0 <= A, B <10, being the values of a and b for the graph. A and B will not both be 0.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each graph, firstly output the equation being plotted on a line by itself. Under this must be the graph. All points on the axes, plus points on the graph must be represented by the * character. The x axis must contain the points 0 to 10 from left to right, the y axis the points 0 to the maximum value from bottom to top.</p>
